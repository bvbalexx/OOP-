Description:

The Restaurant Order Management System (ROMS) is a C++ project utilizing object-oriented programming principles. The primary goal of this program is to efficiently manage the command system within a restaurant, focusing on the availability of the necessary ingredients to fulfill each order. If there are sufficient raw materials to prepare the dishes in an order, the command is processed and added to the system; otherwise, it is rejected.
Key Features:

Object-Oriented Design: The project is implemented using C++ and follows object-oriented programming principles, enhancing code organization and reusability.

Order Management: ROMS efficiently manages restaurant orders, assessing ingredient availability before processing each order.

Ingredient Inventory: The system maintains an inventory of raw materials, dynamically updating quantities as ingredients are used in orders.

Availability Check: Before accepting an order, ROMS checks the availability of all required ingredients to ensure successful preparation.

Order Processing: Processed orders are added to the system, keeping a record of completed transactions and updating ingredient quantities accordingly.
